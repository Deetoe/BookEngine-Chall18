## Overview

This web application serves as a Google Books API-powered search engine, originally built using RESTful routes but enhanced by transitioning to a GraphQL API powered by Apollo Server. Constructed with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), it enables users to browse for books, register or log in, save their favorite books, and manage their personal book list. The project emphasizes the streamlined data management benefits of GraphQL compared to traditional REST methodologies.
